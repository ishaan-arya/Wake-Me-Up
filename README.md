## Inspiration

Oftentimes, we used to have late nights. While we'd set an alarm for the next morning, we'd never be able to wake up as we wanted to sleep more. This had dire consequences; it made us miss a few classes at school, and disrupted our sleep schedules. Waking up late also made some of us more groggy, and grumpy throughout the day! Considering our experience with waking up late and sleep schedules, we asked other students and they had the same problems. They, as well as our team wanted a solution that could get our lazy selves out of bed.

## What it does

"Wake me up" is an alarm application that utilizes QR Code technology to get lazy people, like us, out of bed every morning. The process  is simple yet revolutionary: the user downloads the application, creates his/her profile, and creates his/her alarm. Furthermore, the user will have to print the QR Code given by the application and stick it to the wall in their bathroom. Now here’s the catch! Once you set your alarm, and it rings, it won’t stop ringing, until you scan the QR code in the bathroom, forcing you to get out of bed. 



## How we built it

"Wake me Up" was built using Flutter, Dart, and QR Code technology



## Challenges we ran into
We encounter numerous difficulties while creating the application. Flutter is known to have minimal support when running background tasks, and since our app was that of an alarm, this was highly important. However, we were soon able to figure out how to work around that but encountered another problem. We had issues with playing the audio in the alarm application, and we had to test out various different packages and libraries.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of



## What we learned



## What's next for Wake Me Up
We believe that "Wake Me Up" is a unique, and revolutionary application. Hence, we want to continue to develop the application and hopefully release it into app stores for users to download. In doing so, we hope the will make the world a happier and more productive place.
